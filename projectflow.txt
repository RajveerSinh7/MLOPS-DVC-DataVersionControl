1) create git repo, clone it in local
2) create mycode.py and add code to it (will save .csv file to a new "data" folder)
3) do a git add-commit-push before initialising DVC (for the above fresh csv)
 
>> pip install dvc
>> dvc init
 
4) install and Initiate DVC (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5) define storage for DVC (eg. S3 bucket), here only local folder used.

>> mkdir S3

6) command to add destination for DVC:
>> dvc remote add -d myremote S3

here, myremote->nickname, S3->can be path,url,location here its local folder

7) command to make dvc track versioning of a folder (or data in the folder)
>> dvc add data/ 

here, data-> folder name of dataset to be tracked

8) since git already tracking the folder, resolved the issue of adding it to gitignore and adding to dvc

9) now >>dvc commit && >>dvc push ->these to make dvc insert from "data" folder to S3 and begin tracking (saving initial version)

10) append row in new data to implement a change in our .csv datafile
track changes by >>dvc status

11) >>dvc commit && >>dvc push :these will save new data in S3 along with old data (different versions)

12) add one more row (version 3)
